# Directory_System

The computer OS uses an organizational unit called "directory" to organize the folder and files into a hierarchical structure.
A directory contains multiple files and other directories and it provides user with a logical file group.

A directory uses "/" as a separator character and shows its route within the file system.
"/" may represent a root directory or a hierarchical relationship between parent directories and subdirectories.
For instance, "/aa/bb" indicates that under the root directory, there is the "aa" director, beneath which lies the "bb" directory.

There are various features related to a directory but following 5 features are implemented in this project
- Create a directory
- Remove a directory
- Copy   a directory
- Move   a directory
